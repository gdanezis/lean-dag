# Optimal-Hydrozoan: direct liveness — statement

Two claims form `Statement`. `CommitLiveness` is Hydrozoan's: a
synchronised, populated wave with a correct leader slow-commits — the slow
path is unchanged in Optimal-Hydrozoan, and so is the guaranteed commit;
only the harvest differs (`DecidedOpt`). `SkipLiveness` is what the arc
adds: a slot whose leader produced **no candidate** is directly skipped by
the guaranteed quorum alone — `q_cert ≤ q ≤ |T|` blames at the voting
round, and every decision-round block is fast evidence for nothing,
vacuously. No fault-count hypothesis and no synchrony hypothesis appear.
In Hydrozoan the same skip needs `q_fast = n − p` blames, which only
`Correct` can supply when the actual faults fit `p`; it is opportunistic
there (`SkipLatency`, kept outside `Statement`), and a liveness claim here
(decision D5). The price, recorded in the paper: the verdict lands at the
decision round, one round later than Hydrozoan's.

`SkipLiveness` is deliberately restricted to candidate-less slots. With a
candidate present, the Byzantine replicas can vote for it while every
correct replica blames it, and those `f` votes suffice to make every
correct decision-round block fast evidence whenever `f ≥ tPlain` — at the
minimal committee `tPlain = f + pOpt − 1` when `c + k` is even and
`f + pOpt` when odd, so the attack exists exactly at `c = k = 0` — and the
skip is not guaranteed: the paper's remark on FinWhale's attack. Such a
slot resolves indirectly.

`FastLatency` stays outside `Statement`, as in Hydrozoan: a performance
characterization, firing exactly when the actual faults fit the fast
allowance — now `pOpt`, one more than Hydrozoan's `p`.

/-- **Commit liveness** (Hydrozoan's, harvested as `DecidedOpt`): a
quorum-sized set of correct replicas, populated through the wave's three
rounds and synchronised from some `R` at or before the wave, commits its
correct leader — the slow-commit threshold is met, and the decision logic
outputs the commit verdict on any view caught up to the decision round
(the certificates sit there, so a caught-up view holds them; the eventual
view is caught up to every horizon).

`SlowCommit` here is a threshold fact, not a route: the fast path may also
fire in the same universe — this is the one the guaranteed quorum always
reaches. -/

/-- **Skip liveness** (the arc's addition): a slot with no candidate is
directly skipped by any quorum-sized set of correct replicas that fills
its voting and decision rounds — every voting-round block of `T` blames
the slot, every decision-round block of `T` is fast evidence for no
candidate, and `q_cert ≤ q ≤ |T|` — and the skip verdict is output on any
view caught up to the decision round (the blames and the no-evidence
quorum both sit at or below it). No synchrony and no fault-count
hypothesis: blames and no-evidence reference nothing. `q ≤ |T|` is
deliberately the DAG quorum, uniform with `CommitLiveness`, although
`q_cert ≤ |T|` would suffice. -/

/-- **Performance, not liveness — deliberately outside `Statement`.**
When the *actual* faults fit the Optimal fast allowance `pOpt`, a
synchronised, populated wave with a correct leader fires the fast path in
two rounds: `|Correct| = n − |byzantine ∪ crashed| ≥ n − pOpt = q_fast`.
One more actual fault than Hydrozoan's `FastLatency` admits. It needs all
of `Correct` — a quorum-sized `T` does not suffice in general — and only
the propose and voting rounds. -/
