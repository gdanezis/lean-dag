# Optimal-Hydrozoan: indirect liveness — the graded rule is total

Hydrozoan's `IndirectLiveness` read over `DecidedOpt`. Direct liveness
commits a synchronised wave's slot; the ledger advances only when *every*
slot below gets a verdict, including slots whose leader was faulty or
whose wave predates synchrony — the indirect rule's job. Two claims:

- `AnchoredTotality`: once a nearest eligible committed anchor exists,
  the three-rung ladder always returns a verdict — a certificate rung
  hit, else an evidence-quorum hit, else a skip. Without the tie-break of
  Hydrozoan's weak rung (decision D3), the evidence rung fires on *any*
  candidate clearing it; that this is at most one candidate is slot
  agreement's business, not totality's.
- `DecidedBelowRun`: a run of `c` consecutive committed slots, long
  enough that its last slot anchors everything below (`SpansEligible`,
  reused from Hydrozoan — a schedule-only notion), decides every slot
  below it.

Both claims are pure decision-relation combinatorics: no synchrony,
population, or fault-count hypothesis appears. The witness models
exercise the run length `c ∈ {3, 4}` under the pipelined schedule only;
a non-pipelined schedule (one slot per wave) satisfies `SpansEligible 1`,
where a single committed slot decides everything below — a residual no
witness pins.

`SpansEligible`: a reviewed file importing the reviewed file it mirrors,
as the other Optimal statements do (recorded in `optimal-hydrozoan.md`).

/-- **The graded rule is total.** The premises are verbatim the shared
anchor prefix of the three indirect `DecidedOpt` constructors (minus
`k < j`, which follows from eligibility): an eligible committed anchor
whose eligible in-betweens all skipped. The conclusion: some rung fires
— slot `k` gets a verdict, commit or skip. -/

  ∀ (V : View U.toBlockUniverse) (k j : ℕ) (A : BlockId),

    DecidedOpt U V j (some A) →          -- slot j committed A,
    (∀ i, k < i → i < j →                -- and j is the NEAREST such slot:

      DecidedOpt U V i none) →           -- skipped;
    ∃ v, DecidedOpt U V k v              -- then slot k has a verdict.

/-- **A committed run decides everything below it.** `c` consecutive
committed slots, under the `SpansEligible` runway, force a verdict on
every earlier slot: each such slot anchors on its nearest eligible
committed successor — the run's end if nothing nearer — and the ladder's
totality does the rest. -/
