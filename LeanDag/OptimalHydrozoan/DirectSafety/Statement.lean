# Optimal-Hydrozoan: direct-rule safety — statement

The direct decision rules of Optimal-Hydrozoan never disagree about a
slot. The same five claims as Hydrozoan's `DirectSafety`, over an
`OptUniverse` and views of its underlying universe: fast/fast,
certificate/certificate, slow/slow, fast/slow, and commit/skip. Two of
them — certificate uniqueness and slow/slow agreement — involve only
rules the arc inherits unchanged, so they are Hydrozoan's own claims
applied to `U.toBlockUniverse`; the other three read the Optimal rules.

Each claim rests on a row of `Optimal/ThresholdArithmetic`:
`FastUniqueness` for fast/fast (guarded by `f ≥ 1`; at `f = 0` no replica
equivocates and a slot holds a single candidate, so agreement is by
non-equivocation); `CertUniqueness` for certificates, for slow/slow, and
for the slow half of commit/skip (the `qCert` blames of the Optimal skip
against the `qCert` votes inside a certificate); `CertFastExclusion` for
fast/slow and for the fast half of commit/skip (the blames against the
`qFastOpt` fast voters).

Commit/skip here is the paper's `lem:opt-commit-excludes-direct-skip`
restricted to *direct* commits; its no-evidence half is never needed
against them (the blames suffice) and only matters against the evidence
rung, which is slot agreement's business.

Statements only; the proofs live in `Proof.lean` (generated).
