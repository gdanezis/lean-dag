# Optimal-Hydrozoan: direct-rule safety — proof

Generated proof layer; not part of the audit surface. The inherited rows
are Hydrozoan's `DirectSafety.holds` on the underlying universe. The
Optimal rows follow Hydrozoan's proofs with `qFastOpt` in place of
`qFast`: overlap two author quorums in a non-Byzantine replica
(`Helpers/Counting.lean`), collapse its voting blocks through
`no_equivocation`, and collapse the two candidates through
`distinct_authors`. Fast/fast at `f = 0` is non-equivocation of the
leader directly.
