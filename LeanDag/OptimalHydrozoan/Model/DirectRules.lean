# Optimal-Hydrozoan: direct decision rules

Trusted core of the Optimal-Hydrozoan arc: the fast commit read with the
new allowance, the per-block *fast evidence* of `sections/optimal-protocol.tex`,
and the direct skip of `sections/optimal-algorithms.tex` (`IsFastEvidence`,
`IsNoFastEvidence`, `SkippedLeader`), as predicates over the block universe
plus their view-relative variants. Definitions only.

Everything else of the direct layer is Hydrozoan's, untouched and reused:
`IsVote`, `voteBlocks`, `IsCertificate`, `supporters`, `SlowCommit`, `blames`
and their in-view forms (`Model/DirectRules.lean`). What changes:

* the fast commit counts to `qFastOpt` instead of `qFast`;
* the weak rung's aggregated vote count is replaced by a property of a
  *single* decision-round block — being fast evidence for a candidate —
  with quorums of such blocks counted where Hydrozoan counted votes;
* the direct skip needs `qCert` blames **and** `qCert` decision-round
  blocks that are fast evidence for no candidate; it is decided at the
  decision round, and its blame quorum is `qCert`, not `qFast`.

Quorums of decision-round blocks are stated **existentially over a witness
set**, as `WeakLinked` is (`Model/IndirectRules.lean`): the block property
quantifies over ids, so a `Finset.filter` in the core would need
decidability the core does not carry. The two forms are equivalent
(`Optimal/Helpers/DirectRules.lean`).

**Fidelity** (decision D6): the paper's `IsNoFastEvidence` quantifies over
the candidates *in the local DAG*; here over the universe. The two agree:
being evidence for `L` references a vote for `L` (`tPlain, tEquiv ≥ 1`),
which references `L`, so any view holding the block holds `L`; and a rival
candidate outside the view has no vote among the block's parents, so the
rival clause is view-insensitive. Argued in prose, recorded here.

variable [S : Slots Replica]

/-- `C` is *fast evidence* for `L` in slot `k` (the paper's
`IsFastEvidence(b, b_leader, w)`, Algorithm 3), by cases on whether `C`
witnesses an equivocation in `k`:

* it does not: `C` references votes for `L` from at least `tPlain`
  replicas;
* it does: at least `tEquiv` for `L`, and fewer than `tEquiv` for every
  other candidate of the slot — so a witnessing block is evidence for at
  most one candidate by construction.

Stated as two implications rather than an `if`: no decidability is needed
in the core. Not restricted to candidates, nor to decision-round blocks:
like the paper's procedure, it may hold of a non-candidate `L` or of a
`C` at any round; every consumer guards — `IsNoFastEvidence` and the
decision relation with `IsLeaderBlock`, the quorum sets with `blocksAt`. -/

at all — which is what lets a candidate-less slot be skipped. -/

`qCert` blames at the voting round **and** a no-evidence quorum at the

block referencing no candidate); only the threshold changes, from
`qFast` to `qCert`, and the rule is settled one round later. -/
