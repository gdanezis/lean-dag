# Optimal-Hydrozoan: the decision relation

Trusted core: the per-slot decision procedure of
`sections/optimal-algorithms.tex` — Hydrozoan's `TryDirectDecide` and
`TryIndirectDecide` with the Optimal `SkippedLeader` and `DecideFromAnchor`
— as an inductive relation over an `OptUniverse`. `DecidedOpt U V k (some L)`
says the replica holding view `V` may commit `L` at slot `k`;
`DecidedOpt U V k none` says it may skip the slot; *undecided* is the
absence of any derivation.

As for Hydrozoan's `Decided` (`Model/Decided.lean`): the relation is
**order-free between constructors** — any justifiable verdict is
derivable, and the safety theorems prove the routes never disagree —
while inside the indirect rule the strict grading
`certificate → evidence quorum → skip` **is** encoded, and the anchor is
the **nearest eligible committed** slot.

Two differences with `Decided`. The universe is an `OptUniverse`: only the
decision relation and the safety statements see the leader-exclusion
clause; the rule predicates are applied to `U.toBlockUniverse`. And the
evidence rung carries **no tie-break** (decision D3): two candidates
cannot both clear it — two evidence quorums share a non-Byzantine author
whose unique decision-round block would be evidence for both — so
`argmin digest` of the pseudocode is vacuous; uniqueness is a theorem of
the safety phase, not a premise here. No `LinearOrder BlockId` is needed.
