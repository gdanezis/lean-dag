# Optimal-Hydrozoan: the graded indirect rule's second rung

Trusted core: the evidence rung of the paper's `DecideFromAnchor`
(`sections/optimal-algorithms.tex`, Algorithm 3). Rung 1 — an anchor-linked
certificate — is Hydrozoan's `CertifiedIn`, reused; anchor eligibility is
Hydrozoan's `EligibleAsAnchor`, reused. Rung 2 replaces `WeakLinked`'s
`q_weak` anchor-linked *votes* by `qCert` anchor-linked decision-round
*blocks*, each fast evidence for the candidate.

Stated existentially over a witness set for the same reason as
`WeakLinked` (`Model/IndirectRules.lean`): filtering on `Reaches` would
require deciding reachability, and the computable surrogate is kept out
of the trusted core. The strict rung ordering lives in the decision
relation (`Optimal/Model/Decided.lean`).
