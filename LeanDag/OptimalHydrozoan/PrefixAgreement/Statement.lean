# Optimal-Hydrozoan: prefix agreement — statement

The output guarantee, the safety headline of the arc: replicas' committed
sequences are consistent. Hydrozoan's `PrefixAgreement` read over
`DecidedOpt`: the sequence shapes `commitSeq` (committed leaders in slot
order, skipped slots dropped — the paper's `ExtendCommitSeq`) and `ledger`
(a *memoryless per-leader* linearizer `BlockId → List BlockId` applied to
it) are reused as they are, being generic in the verdict function; only
`DecidesBelow` and the three claims are re-stated, over an `OptUniverse`
and views of its underlying universe.

The linearizer abstraction is narrower than the paper's
`LinearizeSubDags`, which is stateful: its persistent set `H` suppresses
blocks already output under an earlier leader, so what it emits for a
leader depends on the committed prefix before it. That procedure is
prefix-monotone and therefore also prefix-consistent, but the formal
ledger claim covers only linearizers with no such memory. (Inherited
from Hydrozoan's `PrefixAgreement`, which states the same claim.)

Three claims: equal horizons give equal sequences; different horizons
give a prefix (`<+:` is `List.IsPrefix`); and ledgers inherit prefix
consistency for every linearizer. `DecidesBelow` requires a derivation
for every slot below the horizon — an undecided slot has none — so the
claims speak exactly where replicas have produced output. Everything
here is a harvest of `OptimalHydrozoan.SlotAgreement`; no arithmetic row enters
directly. No `LinearOrder BlockId` (decision D3).
