# Optimal-Hydrozoan: the seam lemmas

Generated proof infrastructure for slot agreement; not part of the audit
surface. Hydrozoan's seam (`Helpers/SlotAgreement.lean`) with the weak
rung replaced by the evidence rung:

* the crown lemma — a fast commit makes every decision-round block fast
  evidence for the committed block (the paper's `lem:opt-fast-evidence`;
  the witnessing case is where `OptUniverse.leader_excluded` enters);
* exclusivity — a decision-round block is evidence for one candidate at
  most (`lem:opt-exclusive`);
* rung 2 fires — every block from round `r + 3` on reaches an evidence
  quorum for a fast-committed block (`lem:opt-fast-propagation`);
* starvation and skip — no certificate and no evidence quorum for a
  rival of a fast-committed block, nor for any candidate of a directly
  skipped slot (`lem:opt-commit-excludes-direct-skip`);
* uniqueness at an anchor — two evidence quorums name one candidate
  (`lem:opt-evidence-unique`), which is what lets the evidence rung go
  without a tie-break;
* the at-anchor wrappers for `DecidedOpt`.
