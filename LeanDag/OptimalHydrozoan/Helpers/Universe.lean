# Optimal-Hydrozoan: universe lemmas

Generated proof infrastructure over `Optimal/Model/Universe.lean`; not
part of the audit surface.

`leaderExcluded_of_bounded` is the bridge the witness models use: the
`leader_excluded` field quantifies over every slot `k`, which `decide`
cannot enumerate, but for a universe whose rounds stop at `N` only slots
with a decision round `≤ N` matter, and a concrete schedule bounds those
slots by some `B` (`B = N` for the pipelined schedule, `B = 2N` with two
slots per round) — so the bounded, decidable form suffices. The
`Decidable` instance lets the witness models check
`WitnessesEquivocation` by `decide` (the existential ranges over a
`Fintype` of ids).
