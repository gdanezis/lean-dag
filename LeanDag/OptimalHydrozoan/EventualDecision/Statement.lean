# Optimal-Hydrozoan: eventual decision — the ledger does not stall

Hydrozoan's `EventualDecision` read over `DecidedOpt`: the liveness
headline, composing direct liveness (a synchronised, populated,
correct-led wave commits) with indirect liveness (a committed run settles
everything below). The one ingredient still missing is fairness — the
schedule must actually *offer* runs of correct-led slots — and that is a
schedule-only notion, so `FairRunOn` and `RunsRecur` are Hydrozoan's,
reused verbatim; only the per-universe workhorse is re-stated:

- `RunDecidesBelow`: a synchronised quorum whose members lead the `c`
  slots `b, …, b + c − 1` and fill every round of the run's span decides
  every slot below `b` at the eventual view. No fairness: where the run
  sits is a hypothesis.
- `RunsRecur` (Hydrozoan's): fairness places a `T`-led run past any slot
  and any round.

The two compose by direct application; the composed form is stated and
proven on the generated side (`ledgerProgress` in `Proof.lean`), as in
Hydrozoan. Imports Hydrozoan's `EventualDecision.Statement` and the
Optimal `IndirectLiveness.Statement` for the reused shapes (the
sanctioned reviewed-imports-reviewed exception).
