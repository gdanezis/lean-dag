# Witness: Optimal output sequences

The seven settled slots of `OD` packaged as decision functions, and the
output claims made concrete: the committed-leader sequence below horizon
7 is `[3, 8, 13, 22]` — the evidence-rung commit 8 and the
certificate-rung commit 13 sit in it between the two fast commits — a
shorter-horizon replica's `[3]` is its prefix (in the one-vote-short view
the anchor is undecided, so nothing indirect settles there and the
replica stops at slot 2), a toy linearizer's ledgers keep the prefix, and
`holds` fixes the sequence of *any* replica that has decided below 7 in
*any* view — all three of its conjuncts applied on data, and a verdict
function that drops the evidence-rung commit shown to decide below 7 in
no view.

A second, crash-only universe `OC` on `threeReplicasCrashOnly` (`f = 0`,
one crashed replica of three; `q = qFastOpt = qCert = qSlow = 2`) puts the
Optimal headline theorems through a configuration with no Byzantine
replica at all: a two-of-three fast commit (which Hydrozoan's `qFast = 3`
would not grant), a slow commit, a skip of the crashed leader's slot, and
the sequence `[2, 5]` fixed for every replica.
