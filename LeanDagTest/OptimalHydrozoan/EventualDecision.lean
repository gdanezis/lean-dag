# Witness: Optimal eventual decision, applied

None of the safety witnesses is `T`-synchronised with a `T`-led run of
three slots under its schedule, so this file adds one steady-state
universe `US` on `fourReplicasOpt` (replica `0` Byzantine and silent
after genesis): the three correct replicas author every round from 1 to
6, each block referencing the three correct blocks of the round below.
Under `fourSlotsOpt` (leader `(k + 3) % 4`) the slots led by `1`, `2`, `3`
with a voting round in the table — `0, 2, 3, 4` — fast-commit at exactly
`qFastOpt`; the slots led by `0` (`1`, `5`) have no candidate; slot 6's
candidate has no voting round and the slot is undecided, so "every slot
below the run" is not an accident of a table that decides everything.

* **`RunDecidesBelow` end-to-end**: the run at slots `2, 3, 4` (`c = 3`,
  `T = {1, 2, 3}`, synchronised from `0` and from `2 = slotRound b`, the
  exact boundary of `R ≤ slotRound b`) decides slots `0` and `1` — and
  the verdicts the descent actually derives (the ladder at the nearest
  eligible committed anchor: rung 1 for slot 0, rung 3 for slot 1) are
  pinned and shown to agree with the direct ones.
* **Synchrony from `R > 0` only**: `US'`, the same table with replica 1's
  round-1 block referencing the Byzantine genesis instead of replica 1's
  own, is *not* synchronised from `0` but is from `1`; the run decides
  slots `0` and `1` from `R = 1`. A strengthening of the synchrony
  premise to round `0` fails here.
* **`RunsRecur` and `ledgerProgress` end-to-end**: the schedule is
  provably fair to `{1, 2, 3}` at `c = 3` (a run starts at every
  `4m + 2`), and a singleton `T` is starved at `c = 2` — fairness is not
  trivially true. `ledgerProgress`'s bound `b` is opaque (existential);
  the concrete guard is the `RunDecidesBelow` application.

Disclosed: at `fourReplicasOpt` every quorum the composition consumes
(`q`, `qFastOpt`, `qCert`, `qSlow`) is `3`, `Correct = {1, 2, 3} = T`, and
every run slot also fast-commits — so strengthenings that exchange one
quorum for another, `T` for `Correct`, or the slow path for the fast one
survive this file; a committee separating the quorums (deferred with the
other `n ≥ 5` material) is needed to kill them.
