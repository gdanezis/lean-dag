# Witness: Optimal indirect liveness, applied

`OptimalHydrozoan.IndirectLiveness.holds` on the safety witnesses — no new tables:

* `AnchoredTotality` on `OD` from the anchor 22 at slot 6: slot 2 gets a
  verdict (the firing rung is the evidence rung — no certificate exists;
  this is the one application whose anchor premises are load-bearing, the
  slot having no direct route), slot 1 gets one (rung 3, both rungs
  refuted for its candidate 29; slot 1 is also directly skipped), and
  slot 3 gets one (rung 1; slot 3 is also directly committed). Also from
  the anchor 13 at slot 3, committed through the **slow** path, for
  slot 0; and from a strict sub-view withholding the abstaining vote 28.
* `DecidedBelowRun` on `OE`, whose slots 1–4 all fast-commit: the runs
  `1, 2, 3` (`c = 3`) and `1, …, 4` (`c = 4`) decide slot 0. Disclosed:
  slot 0 of `OE` is also *directly* skipped in the full view (four blames
  — the equivocating leader's other copy blames — and three no-evidence
  blocks), so the descent's only below-run slot is not ladder-only; the
  ladder's own verdict for it, a skip anchored on 14, is derived and
  shown to agree with the direct one through slot agreement. A
  ladder-only below-run slot needs a table of its own (deferred).
* The runway bound is tight: `c = 2` does not span.
