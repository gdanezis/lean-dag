# Witness: the Optimal-Hydrozoan fault model and thresholds

Concrete `OptimalFaults` instances, with their threshold tables pinned by
`decide`, so the class is demonstrably satisfiable and the threshold
formulas of `sections/optimal-protocol.tex`, instantiated at each
configuration, take the expected values:

* `Fin 4` with `f = 1, c = k = 0` — FinWhale's minimal instance, the
  first configuration on which Hydrozoan has no usable fast path
  (`p = 0`, unanimity) and Optimal-Hydrozoan commits on 3 of 4 votes;
* `Fin 3` with `f = 0, c = 1, k = 0` — crash-only: the `f = 0` branch of
  the paper's `lem:opt-thresholds`, and the only place `tEquiv = 1`;
* `Fin 7` with `f = c = k = 1`, lifted from `LeanDagTest.Hydrozoan.Model`'s
  `sevenReplicas`;
* `Fin 6` with `f = 1, c = 1, k = 0` — `c + k` odd, where the last row of
  the lemma holds with slack (and, as at `Fin 3` and `Fin 5`,
  `tPlain = tEquiv`);
* `Fin 5` with `f = 1, c = k = 0` — the `Fin 4` bounds on a committee one
  above the tight size, so the thresholds are seen moving with `n`
  independently of the bound;
* `Fin 20` with `f = 3, c = 4, k = 2` — the mixed configuration of the
  reference implementation's threshold test (mysticeti, `protocol.rs`),
  where every quorum is distinct;
* three local models (not instances): `(f, c, k) = (1, 0, 2)` on six
  replicas — the paper's headline Byzantine-only shape `n = 3f + 2p − 1`
  with `pOpt = 2` —, `(0, 2, 0)` on five, a second crash-only point, and
  `(1, 0, 10)` on fourteen, a slack beyond Hydrangea's cap.

Each table pins `pOpt = p + 1` and `tPlain ≥ 1`; at `Fin 4` and `Fin 3`,
`tPlain = 1` is the boundary the class admits, so an off-by-one in the
subtrahend of `tPlain` (or `p` in place of `pOpt`) fails there. A local
`(f, c, k) = (0, 1, 1)` model shows the `f ≥ 1` guard on
`2·q_fast > n + f` is necessary, and the `(0, 2, 0)` model that `f = 0`
alone does not break the row. The negative examples at the end show the
`nontrivial` field bites: the class is empty at one and two replicas,
and at three — where `Faults` admits `f = c = 0` with `k = 2` — no
instance has `f = c = 0`.
