# Witness: Optimal slot agreement, applied

`OptimalHydrozoan.SlotAgreement.holds` applied to the O4 universes, so that a
silently strengthened hypothesis fails the build, and so that its
consequences are seen on data:

* on `OD`, the evidence-rung commit of slot 2 (the route with no
  certificate anywhere) is the slot's **only** verdict: no skip, no other
  block — across every view; slot 0's fast commit rules out a skip in any
  view; and the anchor's fast commit in the full view fixes the verdict of
  the one-vote-short view, which cannot fast-commit it;
* on `OX`, the fast commit of copy 4 at the equivocating slot 1 rules out
  its rival copy 5 as a verdict in any view (the universe holds no anchor,
  so the data alone already forbids 5 — the application checks the
  theorem's shape), and the direct skip of slot 0 in the full view is the
  only verdict the sub-view `VXs` could ever agree with — `VXs` itself is
  undecided on slot 0;
* on `OE`, **the arc's headline**: the same equivocating leader, but now
  every decision-round block of its slot *witnesses* the equivocation —
  two votes for copy 4, one for copy 5 — so each is fast evidence for 4
  through the `tEquiv` case, none is a certificate, and each omits the
  leader's own block as `leader_excluded` demands. An anchor two rounds
  above reaches the three of them, slot 1 commits copy 4 through the
  evidence rung with rung 1 refuted for *both* copies, and the theorem
  forbids copy 5 as a verdict in every view. (The fast commit of 4 is
  derivable too, at exactly `qFastOpt`; the evidence-rung derivation is
  the one that runs through the witnessing blocks.)

Deferred, as in the earlier witnesses: an `f = 0` universe for the
non-equivocation branch of fast/fast agreement, and a configuration
separating the four quorums that coincide at `n = 4`.
