# Witness: the Optimal-Hydrozoan threshold table, row by row

Every row of `OptimalHydrozoan.ThresholdArithmetic` is `decide`d at each
`OptimalFaults` instance of `LeanDagTest/OptimalHydrozoan/Thresholds.lean`, so
the claims are demonstrably satisfiable before they are proved in
general — and a definition drifting under a row breaks a pinned instance
here before it silently weakens the theorem.

Two boundary facts are pinned separately: the rows that hold with
*equality* at the tight minimal instances (`n = 4`, where every slack is
zero, and `n = 3`, where only row 6 keeps a slack of one), and the
negative that the *unguarded* fast/fast row fails at
`fourCrashOnlySlack` while the guarded `FastUniqueness` holds there — the
`f ≥ 1` guard is load-bearing.

example : Rows (Fin 4) := by decide_rows   -- FinWhale's minimal instance
example : Rows (Fin 5) := by decide_rows   -- non-tight n
example : Rows (Fin 6) := by decide_rows   -- c + k odd

example : Rows (Fin 20) := by decide_rows

-- At n = 4, f = 1, c = k = 0 every slack is zero: rows 2, 4, 6 and the

-- holds even though its guard is off.

-- The guard is load-bearing: at (f, c, k) = (0, 1, 1) the unguarded
