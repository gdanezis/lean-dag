# Witness: the leader-exclusion rule

A four-round universe on `fourReplicasOpt` (four replicas, replica `0`
Byzantine) under a pipelined schedule — slot `k` at round `k`, leader
`(k + 3) % 4`, so slot 1's leader is the Byzantine replica `0`. The
scenario is FinWhale's Figure 1 at `f = p = 1`:

* round 1: replica `0` equivocates — copy A (id 4) and copy B (id 5) —
  while `1`, `2`, `3` propose normally (ids 6–8);
* round 2 (slot 1's voting round): `0`, `1`, `3` vote for A (ids 9, 10,
  12), `2` votes for B (id 11);
* round 3 (slot 1's decision round): id 13 by `1` references the votes
  of `1`, `2`, `3` — it sees A and B, **witnesses** the equivocation, and
  omits replica `0`'s vote; id 14 by `3` references the votes of `0`, `1`,
  `3` — all for A — so it does not witness, and may reference `0`'s vote.

Ids 0–14 form `U`, an `OptUniverse`: the base conditions and the
leader-exclusion clause hold. Id 15, by replica `2`, references the votes
of `0`, `1`, `2` — it witnesses the equivocation *and* references
replica `0`'s block. Ids 0–15 form `Ubad`, a perfectly good Hydrozoan
`BlockUniverse` that **no** `OptUniverse` extends: the clause bites, at
exactly `(b, k, j) = (15, 1, 9)`.

The `leader_excluded` field is discharged through the generated bridge
`leaderExcluded_of_bounded` (rounds stop at 3, so only slots up to a
bound matter), which turns the `∀ k` into a decidable `∀ k ≤ B`.

The same table is read a second time under a **two-slots-per-round**
schedule (`fourSlotsTwoPerRound`): round 1 then carries slot 2, led by
the Byzantine `0`, and slot 3, led by `1`. Block 13 witnesses slot 2's
equivocation and excludes `0`, while it does not witness anything in
slot 3 and legitimately keeps replica `1`'s vote (id 10) — the rule
applies to each slot of a round separately, as the core docstring
claims.
