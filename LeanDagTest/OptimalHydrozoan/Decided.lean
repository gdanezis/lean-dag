# Witness: the Optimal-Hydrozoan decision rules

Two universes on `fourReplicasOpt` (four replicas, `0` Byzantine) under the
pipelined schedule `fourSlotsOpt` (slot `k` at round `k`, leader
`(k + 3) % 4`). Thresholds: `q = qFastOpt = qCert = qSlow = 3`,
`tPlain = 1`, `tEquiv = 2`.

**Part 1** reads O3's `UX` (`LeanDagTest/OptimalHydrozoan/Universe.lean`), the
universe with an equivocation, for the evidence predicate itself:

* block 13 witnesses slot 1 and references two votes for copy 4 and one
  for copy 5 — evidence for 4 (`2 ≥ tEquiv`, rival `1 < tEquiv`), not for 5
  (`1 = tEquiv − 1`): exclusivity and the boundary in one block;
* block 14 does not witness — evidence for 4 by the `tPlain` case, not for
  5 (no vote), and, as the paper's procedure, also "evidence" for the
  non-candidate 6 (consumers guard with `IsLeaderBlock`);
* slot 0 (leader `3`, candidate the genesis block 3) is **directly
  skipped with a candidate present**: every voting-round author blames it
  (block 4 does; the equivocator's other copy 5 votes for it), and three
  of the four decision-round blocks reference no vote for it — exactly
  `qCert` no-evidence authors — while block 11 is evidence and does not
  count. A sub-view withholding block 12 keeps the blames but drops the
  no-evidence count to two, so the in-view skip fails. Slot 1 is not
  skipped, for both reasons at once: no voting block blames it, and
  blocks 13 and 14 are evidence for copy 4. Its candidate 3 has no
  evidence quorum in reach of block 14 either (`¬ EvidenceLinked`).

**Part 2** is a fresh eight-round universe `UD` (ids `Fin 30`, no
equivocation) exercising every constructor of `DecidedOpt`, anchored on
slot 6 (id 22), fast-committed at exactly `qFastOpt` votes — one fewer
than Hydrozoan's `qFast`, pinned side by side:

* slot 0 (candidate 3): `directFast` and `directSlow`;
* slot 1 (candidate 29, which no block ever references): `directSkip`,
  and `indirectSkip` anchored on slot 6 with both rungs **refuted for the
  candidate** — the eligible in-between slots 4 and 5 disposed of by
  their skips;
* slots 4, 5: no candidate, `directSkip` (the vacuous no-evidence case);
* slot 2 (candidate 8, FinWhale's Figure 4): a single correct vote (id 14)
  that every round-4 block references — no certificate exists anywhere,
  the direct skip's blame half holds but its no-evidence half fails, and
  `indirectEvidence` is the **only** route;
* slot 3 (candidate 13): `indirectCert` through certificate 18, a parent
  of the anchor — at `n = 4`, where `qCert = qFastOpt`, `directFast` and
  `directSlow` are derivable too (the relation is order-free);
* slot 6: `directFast`; a view withholding one vote has `2 < 3`.

Every premise is stated against the base universe `UD`; the `OptUniverse`
`OD` is `UD` with the (vacuous, equivocation-free) exclusion clause, and
definitional unfolding carries the facts across.

Not exercised here, deliberately: a no-evidence quorum with fewer than
`qCert` blames, a rival at exactly `tEquiv`, and a witnessing block that
is evidence for nothing all need `q ≥ 4` parents (at `n = 4`, `q = n − 1`),
and separating `q`, `qFastOpt`, `qCert`, `qSlow` (all `3` here) needs a
larger committee — witness material for the safety phases.
