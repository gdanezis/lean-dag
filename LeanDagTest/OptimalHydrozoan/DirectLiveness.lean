# Witness: Optimal direct liveness, applied

The liveness claims applied to the universes of the safety witnesses —
no new tables:

* `OC`, crash-only on three replicas (`Correct = {1, 2}`, replica `0`
  crashed): the correct pair fills every round and each of its blocks
  references both correct blocks of the round below, so it is
  synchronised from round 0. `holds` commits slot 0 through the slow path
  and skips slot 1, the crashed leader's candidate-less slot, through
  `SkipLiveness`; `fastLatency` fast-commits slot 0 under `pOpt = 1`
  actual fault — where Hydrozoan's premise (`≤ p = 0`) is false: the
  one-more-fault claim on data.
* `OD`, the six-route universe: `SkipLiveness` on its candidate-less
  slots 4 and 5 with `T = {1, 2, 3}`; and `OD` is not `T`-synchronised
  (block 12 omits replica 1's block 8) — the synchrony premise bites.
* `OA`, FinWhale's attack on the skip, the reason `SkipLiveness` is
  restricted to candidate-less slots: the Byzantine leader's candidate is
  blamed by every correct voting-round block, the correct replicas fill
  the decision round — every premise of `SkipLiveness` holds except the
  candidate-less one — yet the slot is **not** skipped, because each
  correct decision-round block references the Byzantine replica's vote
  for the candidate and is thereby fast evidence for it (`tPlain = 1`).

Disclosed residuals, as in Hydrozoan's witness: at `OC` the fault bounds
themselves force `|byzantine ∪ crashed| ≤ 1 = pOpt`, so `fastLatency`'s
fault-count premise is inert there (only its Hydrozoan counterpart
`≤ p = 0` is refuted); and every application has `R = 0 = slotRound 0`,
so `R ≤ slotRound k` is never exercised strictly. A `SkipLiveness`
instance with more actual faults than `pOpt` and a non-synchronised
decision block needs a larger committee (deferred with the other
`n ≥ 5` material).
