# Witness: Optimal-Hydrozoan grounding

End-to-end applications of the Optimal grounding theorem — the
mechanical guard against silently strengthened hypotheses (any added
explicit premise breaks an application by arity; the spelled-out example
types break conclusion weakenings by type mismatch, in particular a
retreat from `OptUniverse` to `BlockUniverse`):

* `WaveRobinFair` applied premise-free at `sevenReplicasOpt`
  (Byzantine `{0}`, crashed `{1}`, `q = 5`), at `fourReplicasOpt`
  (Byzantine `{0}`, `q = 3`) and at `threeReplicasCrashOnly` — the
  smallest committee carrying any `OptimalFaults` instance, and the
  `f = 0` branch — including a run extracted past slot 5;
* `HypothesesRealizable`, its conclusion typed at `OptUniverse`: on
  `Fin 7` at `T = univ` — a `T` containing the Byzantine replica 0 and
  the crashed replica 1, killing any `T ⊆ Correct` strengthening — and
  at `T = Correct` with `|T| = 5 = q`, the exact-quorum boundary, both
  under the wave-aligned schedule (`Fin 7` carries no `Slots` instance,
  so the schedule is passed explicitly); on `Fin 4` at `T = Correct`,
  `|T| = 3 = q`, under the two-slots-per-round schedule
  `fourSlotsTwoPerRound` — the `Slots` quantifier is real, not fixed to
  `waveRobin`; and on `Fin 20` at `|T| = 13 = q < qFastOpt = 16`, the
  one configuration here whose quorums separate, so a strengthening of
  the premise to `qFastOpt ≤ |T|` fails;
* the premise's negative: on `Fin 4`, a `T`-only universe with
  `|T| = 2 < q` cannot populate round 1 — the prose "past genesis, a
  `T`-only universe cannot validly populate a round below quorum size"
  made a theorem;
* `GroundedProgress` applied at `k = 5` (`Fin 7`), at the `k = 0`
  boundary (`Fin 4`) and at `Fin 3`, its three conclusion clauses —
  correct authors only, the commit at the bound, the decisions below
  it — spelled out over `DecidedOpt`.

Disclosed: in every universe realizing the package there is no
equivocation, so leader exclusion is inert — `HypothesesRealizable`
says the rule is compatible with the good case, not that it bites. Where
it bites is pinned in `LeanDagTest/OptimalHydrozoan/Universe.lean` (`UbadX`, a
block universe admitting no `OptUniverse`). Two `Faults (Fin 7)`
instances are in scope (`sevenReplicas` and `sevenReplicasOpt.toFaults`);
they are definitionally the same structure, so `Correct : Finset (Fin 7)`
names one pool. The pointwise pins of `waveRobin`, the `T = ∅` fairness
negative and the per-slot-rotation starvation contrast are Hydrozoan's
(`LeanDagTest/Hydrozoan/Grounding.lean`) and are not repeated: the schedule and
the fairness claim are reused verbatim.
