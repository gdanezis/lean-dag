# Witness: Optimal direct-rule safety, applied

`OptimalHydrozoan.DirectSafety.holds` applied to the O4 universes, so that a
silently strengthened hypothesis in the statement fails the build, and
so that its consequences are seen on data:

* on `OX`, fast/fast agreement does real work: slot 1 has **two**
  candidates, copies 4 and 5 of the equivocating Byzantine leader, and
  copy 4 fast-commits at exactly `qFastOpt`; the theorem then says every
  fast-committing candidate of the slot *is* 4 — a conclusion the
  candidate premise alone does not force;
* on `OD`, fast/fast pins the anchor, fast/slow pins slot 3, and the two
  inherited rows — certificate uniqueness and slow/slow, the latter
  across two distinct views — pin slot 0;
* on `OX`, commit/skip exclusion turns the direct skip of slot 0 into a
  refutation of both direct commits of its candidate 3, in any view — and,
  with the universe too short to hold any anchor, into
  `¬ DecidedOpt OX VX 0 (some 3)` outright: a skipped slot commits by no
  route.

Deferred (needs an equivocation in `UD`, or `n ≥ 5`): a Byzantine replica
voting and blaming at once (three votes, two blames), a skip with exactly
`qCert < qFast` blames, and an `f = 0` universe for fast/fast's
non-equivocation branch.

-- Fast/fast with a rival: slot 1 of OX has candidates 4 and 5 (the
-- Byzantine leader's two copies); 4 gathers exactly qFastOpt votes.
example :

      supporters UX 5 2 = {2} := by

-- So every fast-committing candidate of slot 1 is 4 — not 5, which the
-- premise `IsLeaderBlock` alone would allow.
example :
    ∀ L, IsLeaderBlock OX.toBlockUniverse 1 L →
      FastCommitOptInView OX.toBlockUniverse VX L (Slots.slotRound (Fin 4) 1) → L = 4 :=

-- Fast/fast agreement at slot 6 of OD: whatever fast-commits there is 22.
