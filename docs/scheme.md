# lean-dag — the unified decider: design record

The object is a unified decider for the single-tier rules of the
Mysticeti codebase (`fast_path = None`): one commit loop and one set of
decision rules, parameterised by a flat record, given as pseudocode with
a table of rows (Cordial Miners PS and Async, Mysticeti, Mahi-Mahi, Blue
Bottle PS and Async, Orcaella, Nemo-Nemo, and four derived rows). The arc
lives in `LeanDag/Scheme/` and changes no rule of the development; the
report's account is §27.

## 1. The parameters

`Scheme.Params` has the six parameters of the table: `waveLength`,
`voteIsCert`, `commitThreshold`, `skipThreshold`, `certThreshold` and
`linkSize`. Leader count and pipelining are the schedule's (`Slots`), not
the rule's, and stake is read as one unit per validator. Each row is a
function of the committee size `n`, the Byzantine bound `f` and the crash
bound `c` (`Params.mysticeti`, `Params.orcaella`, …), at the table's
values. The table's conditions are `Params.TwoRound` (with `q`
references per block: skip plus link and commit plus link at least
`n + f + 1`, link at most `commit + q − n − f`), `Params.ThreeRound`
(twice the certificate threshold, skip plus certificate, and commit plus
`q`, each at least `n + f + 1`) and `Params.Live` (each threshold at most
`n − f − c`).

## 2. The table's claims

`Scheme/Table/Statement.lean` states the reading paragraph's claims and
`Proof.lean` proves them by linear arithmetic:

* every published row meets its family's inequalities and the liveness
  bound, Cordial Miners but its skip threshold `n`;
* the derived rows meet what their published counterpart meets;
* Orcaella meets its inequalities at every `n ≥ 5f + 3c + 1`;
* the inequalities with the liveness bound force `n ≥ 5f + 3c + 1` (two
  rounds) and `n ≥ 3f + 2c + 1` (three rounds), and at those committees
  force Orcaella's and Hybrid Mysticeti's thresholds, and Mysticeti's at
  `c = 0`.

**Finding.** Nemo-Nemo's row is no two-round solution: at `f = 0`,
`n = 2c + 1` and `c ≥ 1`, commit plus link is `c + 2 < n + 1`. The
table's "Nemo-Nemo at `f = 0`" does not follow from the inequalities;
their solution at `f = 0` is Orcaella's `3c + 1`. The failing inequality
guards against an equivocating twin, which the crash model excludes.

## 3. The rule

`Scheme.schemeAnchored` is Algorithm 2 as an `AnchoredRule` with one
rung: the supported-leader test is the direct commit, the skipped-leader
test the direct skip, the certified-link test the rung, the least identifier the tie-break, and
the wave `waveLength − 1`. The vote round is `voteOffset` above the
candidate: the decision round when `voteIsCert`, otherwise the round
below it, and at least one.

**The vote.** The scheme's `VotedBlock` returns the first block of the
slot met walking the voter's references in stored order. The block
record keeps references as a `Finset`, so the vote is a parameter,
`Scheme.VoteSel`: a selection returning a block of the slot from the
voter's history below it when there is one, and none otherwise. Every
claim is stated at every `VoteSel`; `LeanDagTest/Scheme/LeastSel.lean`
builds one, the least block in the history.

## 4. Two rules the rows name

The table writes "no direct skip" as a skip threshold of `n`.

* **Cordial Miners PS.** On the core's universe every non-genesis block
  references a block of its own author, so the leader's vote-round block
  never blames its own slot and `n` blames never occur. The row is
  `cordialAnchored`, the core with no direct skip; it has the core's laws
  (`cordialLaws`).
* **Nemo-Nemo.** Nemo's validity has no self-parent clause, so `n`
  blames occur when every vote-round block omits the leader's block. The
  row is `nemoBlameAnchored`, Nemo's rule with that direct skip; it has
  Nemo's laws (`nemoBlameLaws`), the skip cases by the observation that a
  blame from every validator leaves no vote for the candidate in a model
  where nobody equivocates. Its rung reads a vote in the anchor's
  history, so its anchors are blocks of the record (`Anchor := A ∈ U.ids`).

**Finding.** The scheme's Nemo-Nemo is not this development's Nemo-Nemo:
it skips directly where Nemo waits for an anchor. Both are safe.

## 5. The rows as carriers

`Scheme.ReadAlike` is what `Decided` reads; `ReadAlike.decided_iff`
proves that two rules agreeing on it decide alike, and `toDagRule_eq`
that their carriers are equal. One round above the candidate, a vote is a
reference and a blame a reference to no candidate (`votes_iff`,
`blamersAt_eq`). `Scheme/Equiv/Statement.lean` then states, at every
`VoteSel`:

| Row | Carrier | Condition |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Mysticeti | `mysticetiRule` | none |
| Blue Bottle PS | `odontocetiRule` | none |
| Orcaella | `hybridRule (n − 3f − 2c)` | `n = 5f + 3c + 1` |
| Cordial Miners PS | `cordialAnchored`, with `Agree` | none |
| Nemo-Nemo | `nemoBlameAnchored`, with `Agree` | `n = 2c + 1` |

Mysticeti has no tie-break; the scheme's least choice there is the one
linked candidate, by `coreLaws.link_unique`. Orcaella's skip threshold
`4f + 2c + 1` equals Hybrid's `n − f − c` only at the bound.

**Open.** The rows with buffer rounds (Mahi-Mahi, Blue Bottle Async,
Cordial Miners Async and the asynchronous derived rows), where the
scheme's first-in-order vote and the development's least vote can name
different twins; the laws of the derived rows; and the commit loop
`TryDecide` as an algorithm.
