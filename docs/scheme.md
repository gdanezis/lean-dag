# lean-dag — the unified decider: design record

The object is a unified decider for the single-tier rules of the
Mysticeti codebase (`fast_path = None`): one commit loop and one set of
decision rules, parameterised by a flat record, given as pseudocode with
a table of rows (Cordial Miners PS and Async, Mysticeti, Mahi-Mahi, Blue
Bottle PS and Async, Orcaella, Nemo-Nemo, and four derived rows). The arc
lives in `LeanDag/Scheme/` and changes no rule of the development; the
report's account is §27.

## 0. Key findings

Each finding is machine-checked unless marked otherwise; the Lean names
are the evidence.

**What holds.**

* **The table's arithmetic.** Every published row meets its family's
  inequalities and the liveness bound (Cordial Miners except its skip
  threshold `n`); the derived rows meet what their published counterparts
  meet; Orcaella meets its inequalities at every `n ≥ 5f + 3c + 1`. The
  inequalities with the liveness bound force `n ≥ 5f + 3c + 1` (two
  rounds) and `n ≥ 3f + 2c + 1` (three rounds), and at those committees
  force Orcaella's and Hybrid Mysticeti's thresholds, and Mysticeti's at
  `c = 0` (`Scheme.Table.holds`).
* **Five rows are rules of the development**, at every vote-selection
  rule (`Scheme.Equiv.holds`): Mysticeti is `mysticetiRule`, Blue Bottle
  PS is `odontocetiRule`, Orcaella at `n = 5f + 3c + 1` is
  `hybridRule (n − 3f − 2c)`; Cordial Miners PS and Nemo-Nemo are the
  variants of §4, each with laws and agreement. Every theorem of those
  carriers holds of the decider at those parameters.
* **Three rows with buffer rounds are rules of the development at the
  least vote** (`Scheme.Equiv.holds`): Mahi-Mahi at `w ≥ 3` is
  `mahiMahiRule w`, Blue Bottle Async is `asyncBlueBottleRule`, and
  Cordial Miners Async is `cordialAsyncAnchored 5`, Mahi-Mahi at wave five
  with no direct skip, with Mahi-Mahi's laws. Their thresholds, fault
  bounds and wave lengths are the rules'.

**What the table claims and does not hold, or holds otherwise.**

1. **Nemo-Nemo is no solution of the two-round inequalities.** At
   `f = 0`, `n = 2c + 1` and `c ≥ 1`, its commit plus link is `c + 2`,
   below `n + 1 = 2c + 2` (`Table.NemoNotTwoRound`). The table's "Nemo-Nemo
   at `f = 0`" does not follow from the inequalities; their solution at
   `f = 0` is Orcaella's `n = 3c + 1`. The inequality that fails guards
   against equivocating twins, which a crash-only model excludes, so
   Nemo-Nemo is safe for a reason the table does not state.
2. **The scheme's Nemo-Nemo is not this development's Nemo-Nemo.** Nemo's
   validity has no self-parent clause, so a skip threshold of `n` is met
   when every vote-round block, the leader's included, omits the leader's
   block; the scheme then skips directly, where Nemo waits for an anchor.
   The extra skip is safe (`Scheme.nemoBlameLaws`). That the threshold can
   be met follows from the validity definition; no witness DAG exhibits it.
3. **Cordial Miners' "no direct skip" holds unconditionally.** The table's
   footnote says a skip threshold of `n` never triggers under faults. On
   the core's universe every block references its author's previous block,
   so the leader never blames its own slot and `n` blames never occur
   (`Scheme.not_holdsAtLeast_card_slotBlamers`). Cordial Miners PS is the
   core with no direct skip, with the core's laws (`Scheme.cordialLaws`).
4. **Orcaella above its bound is a different rule.** Its fixed skip
   threshold `4f + 2c + 1` equals Hybrid's `n − f − c` only at
   `n = 5f + 3c + 1`. Above it the inequalities hold, but the row reads
   differently from Hybrid and its laws are not proved.
5. **The vote is a parameter, and decides the rows with buffer rounds.**
   The scheme's vote is the first block of the slot met in reference
   order; this development's is the least block in the voter's history.
   One round above the candidate both are the reference (`Scheme.votes_iff`),
   which is why five rows match at every vote. With buffer rounds a
   voter's history can hold both twins of an equivocating leader and the
   two votes can differ, so Mahi-Mahi, Blue Bottle Async and Cordial
   Miners Async are read at the least vote only. Every vote blames as
   Mahi-Mahi blames (`Scheme.sel_eq_none_iff_blames`), and Mahi-Mahi's
   safety uses its vote only through uniqueness, membership in the
   history and exclusion of a blame, which every vote has; safety at every
   vote is therefore expected, and is argued, not proved.

**Open.** The buffer-round rows at votes other than the least; the laws of
the derived rows (Hybrid Mysticeti, Async Orcaella, Async Nemo-Nemo,
Hybrid Mahi-Mahi), whose inequalities only are checked; and the commit
loop `TryDecide` as an algorithm.

## 1. The parameters

`Scheme.Params` has the six parameters of the table: `waveLength`,
`voteIsCert`, `commitThreshold`, `skipThreshold`, `certThreshold` and
`linkSize`. Leader count and pipelining are the schedule's (`Slots`), not
the rule's, and stake is read as one unit per validator. Each row is a
function of the committee size `n`, the Byzantine bound `f` and the crash
bound `c` (`Params.mysticeti`, `Params.orcaella`, …), at the table's
values. The table's conditions are `Params.TwoRound` (with `q`
references per block: skip plus link and commit plus link at least
`n + f + 1`, link at most `commit + q − n − f`), `Params.ThreeRound`
(twice the certificate threshold, skip plus certificate, and commit plus
`q`, each at least `n + f + 1`) and `Params.Live` (each threshold at most
`n − f − c`).

## 2. The table's claims

`Scheme/Table/Statement.lean` states the reading paragraph's claims and
`Proof.lean` proves them by linear arithmetic:

* every published row meets its family's inequalities and the liveness
  bound, Cordial Miners but its skip threshold `n`;
* the derived rows meet what their published counterpart meets;
* Orcaella meets its inequalities at every `n ≥ 5f + 3c + 1`;
* the inequalities with the liveness bound force `n ≥ 5f + 3c + 1` (two
  rounds) and `n ≥ 3f + 2c + 1` (three rounds), and at those committees
  force Orcaella's and Hybrid Mysticeti's thresholds, and Mysticeti's at
  `c = 0`.

**Finding.** Nemo-Nemo's row is no two-round solution: at `f = 0`,
`n = 2c + 1` and `c ≥ 1`, commit plus link is `c + 2 < n + 1`. The
table's "Nemo-Nemo at `f = 0`" does not follow from the inequalities;
their solution at `f = 0` is Orcaella's `3c + 1`. The failing inequality
guards against an equivocating twin, which the crash model excludes.

## 3. The rule

`Scheme.schemeAnchored` is Algorithm 2 as an `AnchoredRule` with one
rung: the supported-leader test is the direct commit, the skipped-leader
test the direct skip, the certified-link test the rung, the least identifier the tie-break, and
the wave `waveLength − 1`. The vote round is `voteOffset` above the
candidate: the decision round when `voteIsCert`, otherwise the round
below it, and at least one.

**The vote.** The scheme's `VotedBlock` returns the first block of the
slot met walking the voter's references in stored order. The block
record keeps references as a `Finset`, so the vote is a parameter,
`Scheme.VoteSel`: a selection returning a block of the slot from the
voter's history below it when there is one, and none otherwise. Every
claim of the rows one round up is stated at every `VoteSel`;
`Scheme.leastSel` is one, the least block in the history and Mahi-Mahi's
vote, and the rows with buffer rounds are read at it (§5).

## 4. Three rules the rows name

The table writes "no direct skip" as a skip threshold of `n`.

* **Cordial Miners PS.** On the core's universe every non-genesis block
  references a block of its own author, so the leader's vote-round block
  never blames its own slot and `n` blames never occur. The row is
  `cordialAnchored`, the core with no direct skip; it has the core's laws
  (`cordialLaws`).
* **Cordial Miners Async.** The leader's vote-round block reaches a
  block of the leader at the candidate's round through its self-parent
  chain (`exists_self_ancestor`), so `n` blames never occur at any wave.
  The row is `cordialAsyncAnchored 5`, Mahi-Mahi's rule at wave five with
  no direct skip; it has Mahi-Mahi's laws (`cordialAsyncLaws`).
* **Nemo-Nemo.** Nemo's validity has no self-parent clause, so `n`
  blames occur when every vote-round block omits the leader's block. The
  row is `nemoBlameAnchored`, Nemo's rule with that direct skip; it has
  Nemo's laws (`nemoBlameLaws`), the skip cases by the observation that a
  blame from every validator leaves no vote for the candidate in a model
  where nobody equivocates. Its rung reads a vote in the anchor's
  history, so its anchors are blocks of the record (`Anchor := A ∈ U.ids`).

**Finding.** The scheme's Nemo-Nemo is not this development's Nemo-Nemo:
it skips directly where Nemo waits for an anchor. Both are safe.

## 5. The rows as carriers

`Scheme.ReadAlike` is what `Decided` reads; `ReadAlike.decided_iff`
proves that two rules agreeing on it decide alike, and `toDagRule_eq`
that their carriers are equal. One round above the candidate, a vote is a
reference and a blame a reference to no candidate (`votes_iff`,
`blamersAt_eq`). `Scheme/Equiv/Statement.lean` then states, at every
`VoteSel`:

| Row | Carrier | Condition |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Mysticeti | `mysticetiRule` | none |
| Blue Bottle PS | `odontocetiRule` | none |
| Orcaella | `hybridRule (n − 3f − 2c)` | `n = 5f + 3c + 1` |
| Cordial Miners PS | `cordialAnchored`, with `Agree` | none |
| Nemo-Nemo | `nemoBlameAnchored`, with `Agree` | `n = 2c + 1` |

Mysticeti has no tie-break; the scheme's least choice there is the one
linked candidate, by `coreLaws.link_unique`. Orcaella's skip threshold
`4f + 2c + 1` equals Hybrid's `n − f − c` only at the bound.

At the least vote, the rows with buffer rounds (`Helpers/Buffered.lean`):

| Row | Carrier | Condition |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Mahi-Mahi | `mahiMahiRule w` | `w ≥ 3` |
| Blue Bottle Async | `asyncBlueBottleRule` | none |
| Cordial Miners Async | `cordialAsyncAnchored 5`, with `Agree` | none |

Below the voter, any `VoteSel` returns nothing exactly when Mahi-Mahi's
`Blames` holds (`sel_eq_none_iff_blames`), and `leastSel` votes exactly
as Mahi-Mahi's `Votes` (`leastSel_votes_iff`). Mahi-Mahi has no
tie-break; two linked candidates are one block by
`MahiMahi.eq_of_hasCertificate`.

**Open.** The rows with buffer rounds at votes other than the least,
where the scheme's first-in-order vote and the least vote can name
different twins; the asynchronous derived rows; the laws of the derived
rows; and the commit loop `TryDecide` as an algorithm.
